1. What are you offering?

	Minimum viable product and prototype development consulting.

2. Whom are you offering it to?

	Non-technical startup founders whom cannot find a technical co-founder to work for sweat equity to get to the MVP stage. The goal is to get you to the point where you may be profitable on day one, and/or be able to raise a round of funding post-MVP.

	Until you find and hire your technical co-founder, let's work together to validate your hypotheses.

3. What will be the experience?

	You fill out a short questionnaire about you and the product you'd like to bring to market.
I get back to you if I determine that we may be able to work together to help you get your idea to an MVP.
We schedule a 30 minute conversation to dive deeper into each question of the questionnaire.
If there's still a fit, we draft our an iterative work plan based on your budget, and hit the ground running.
